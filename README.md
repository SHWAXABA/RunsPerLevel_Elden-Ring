# RunsPerLevel_Elden Ring
 Just a simple program that calculates how many runs you need to make to reach your desired stat level in the game Elden Ring

 INSTRUCTIONS:
================================================================================================================================
1) Enter the Rune amount needed to move up a level

    Note: Because the game increases the amount needed to move up after each level it is recommended to go for at least one more run to reach the desired stat level.

2) Enter the amount of levels you need to move up

3) Enter the the amount of runes a single creature drops (Golden Scarab is recommended for more Runes and less Runs)

4) Enter the amount of kills you make per run (e.g. how many creatures can you kill before returning to a site of Grace)


The Program will then tell you how many Runs you need to go on and how many kills you need to make to reach your desired stat level
